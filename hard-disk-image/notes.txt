This disk is a full-on 2.11bsd installation. Additionaly, the install is modified to add
wifid to the package. After booting this, you should be able to login as root with
the password 'esppdp11', or as the unprivileged user 'pdp11' with the same password.

To connect to a wifi network, as root, use wifid. For instance, to connect to the
access point called MyWLAN with the password MyPassword, use:
wifid -connect MyWLAN MyPassword
wifid will remember the last-connected ssid and password and reconnect to that
network on device startup.

One last note: Be sure to always shut down your 2.11BSD session. The file system is somewhat
prone to corruption if you just do the equivalent of pulling the plug instead of using
the 'halt' command to shut things down.

To use the disk, unzip and put the resulting file in the root of a FAT32-formatted 
micro-SD-card. The ESP32 SimH build will automatically pick it up and boot it. Do note
that starting up requires some manual interaction: you have to press 'enter' at the very 
first prompt ':' to boot into the OS. Then, at the prompt that follows about a minute later
'#', press ctrl-D to exit single-user mode and boot into the full system.
